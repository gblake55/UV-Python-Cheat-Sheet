# UV-Python-Cheat-Sheet

I've created a comprehensive one-page cheat sheet for UV, the Python package manager from Astral. The cheat sheet covers:

Installation instructions for different platforms
Python version management - installing and switching between Python versions
Virtual environments - creating and activating venvs
Project management - the modern workflow with uv init, add, lock, and sync
Pip-compatible interface - drop-in replacement commands for pip users
Scripts - managing single-file Python scripts with inline dependencies
Tools - installing CLI tools like ruff, pytest (similar to pipx)
Package building & publishing
Common options and configuration
Quick reference table for the most common tasks

The cheat sheet is formatted in Markdown for easy reference and can be saved, printed, or converted to PDF. It emphasizes UV's key advantage: being 10-100x faster than pip GitHub
